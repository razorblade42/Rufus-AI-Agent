# Rufus - Intelligent Web Data Extraction for RAG Agents

## Overview

Rufus is an AI-powered web scraping agent designed to intelligently extract relevant content from websites based on user-defined prompts. This tool allows engineers to input brief instructions and dynamically retrieve, filter, and synthesize the most relevant data for downstream LLM applications, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents.

## Features

- **Intelligent Crawling:** Crawl websites and selectively retrieve content based on user input.
- **Content Filtering:** Filter relevant content using NLP techniques and keyword matching.
- **Structured Output:** Synthesize content into structured documents ready for RAG systems.
- **Error Handling:** Handle nested pages, broken links, and dynamically-loaded content.
